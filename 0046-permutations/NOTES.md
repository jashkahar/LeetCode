# Backtracking Solution: Generating All Permutations
​
## Problem Statement
​
Given a set of input values, generate all permutations using these values with no repetitions.
​
## Approach: Backtracking
​
1. **Recursive Decision Tree**:
- To explore all permutations, recursively build a decision tree.
- At each step, choose one character, and then explore other possibilities by branching further down the tree.
​
2. **Base Case**:
- The base case is reached when we cannot go deeper (i.e., when the permutation is complete and all positions are filled).
3. **Backtracking Step**:
- Once the base case is met, we backtrack by removing the last added character (i.e., pop back).
- This step allows the exploration of new possibilities by considering different characters for the next position.
​
## Summary
​
This approach systematically builds all permutations by making decisions at each step, exploring all paths, and backtracking when necessary to ensure no repetitions in the permutations.

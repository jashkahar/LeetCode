# Trick: Using a Monotonic Stack for Daily Temperatures
​
## Key Insight
​
To efficiently solve the problem of finding how many days until a warmer temperature, use a monotonic stack:
​
- **Monotonic Stack**: Maintain a stack that keeps track of previous temperatures and their indices as tuples.
- **Stack Operations**:
- As you iterate through the temperatures, compare the current temperature with the temperature at the top of the stack.
- **Pop** from the stack when the current temperature is higher than the temperature at the top of the stack, as this means you've found a warmer day.
- **Update the Result**: For each popped element, calculate the difference in days between the current day and the day at the top of the stack, and update the result array.
- **Continue**: Push the current temperature and index as a tuple onto the stack and proceed with the iteration.
​
This approach ensures that each temperature is processed in an optimal way, maintaining the stack's monotonic property to efficiently find the solution.

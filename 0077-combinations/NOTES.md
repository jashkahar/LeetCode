# Understanding the Solution: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Backtracking
​
## Key Insight
​
When the goal is to find all possible solutions, Depth-First Search (DFS) or backtracking is often the appropriate approach.
​
### Key Concepts
​
- **Combination vs. Permutation**:
- A combination is not a permutation. In combinations, the order does not matter, so repetitions are not desired.
​
## Approach
​
1. **Base Case**:
- The base case occurs when the current combination's length matches the desired length `k`.
2. **Recursive Backtracking**:
- Add the current element to the combination.
- Recursively call the backtrack function to explore further.
- After returning from the recursive call, clean up by removing the last element (i.e., pop back) to explore new possibilities.
​
This approach ensures that all combinations are considered without repetitions, adhering to the principle that the order does not matter in combinations.

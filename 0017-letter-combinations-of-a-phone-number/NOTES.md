# Solution Explanation: Brute Force and Backtracking
​
## The Trick
​
To find every possible solution using brute force, we'll employ a backtracking approach.
​
## Steps
​
1. **Map the Digits to Characters**:
- First, map each digit to its corresponding set of characters (e.g., on a telephone keypad).
​
2. **Backtracking**:
- For each character in the current digit, recursively call the backtrack function to build the string.
- Continue this process until the current string length matches the length of the digits given.
​
## Stopping Condition
​
- The recursion stops when the current string length is equal to the length of the input digits.
​
## Time Complexity
​
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(4^n)**, where `n` is the number of digits given.
